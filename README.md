# Getting Started with Your Personal Portfolio Using React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to use
This is a simple firebase project. You need to create a firebase account and allow Firebase Auth, Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Storage. After allowing your all buckets then copy your confirmation 'code inside the firebase setting' and replace it into '/src/firebase.js' file. example:

```
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "",
    authDomain: "",
    databaseURL: "",
    projectId: "",
    storageBucket: "",
    messagingSenderId: "",
    appId: "",
    measurementId: ""
};
```
That's it your configuration completed.

## How to run Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
First run:
### `npm install`
If this run successfully then
### `npm start`
or
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
